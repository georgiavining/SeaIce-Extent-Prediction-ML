## To-do

- Implement a different model from linear regression --> possibly a decision tree regressor or time-series based model such as SARIMA or Holt-Winters
--> need to do a lit review on them and consider how hard they would be to code

- Extrapolate using the linear regression model/new model to predict the first ice free year

- Start writing up the methods and results in the report
